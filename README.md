# Personal Portfolio Website
This is my personal portfolio website code, which sheds insights on who I am, what I do, 
and what I am capable of doing. At the bottom of every page, it has my resume, LikedIn
and Github linked as well as a way to email me. I currently have 2 portfolio pieces on display
with a third coming soon! I have included a blueprint of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that makes
this work. This website is hosted on Glitch.com.

## Getting Started
---
Go to my profile and click on the link to my personal website.

You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. You will want
to use the "Live Server" extension found on VSCode. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the index.html file and the click "go live" in the bottom 
corner to open the file in a browser.

## Project Structure
---
The project files and folders are organized as follows:
```
Portfolio Website Code  (project root folder)
+-- HTML                (folder for HTML elements)
  +-- index             (main page for website)
  +-- more-about-me     (page that has more information about me)
  +-- portfolio-item-1  (portfolio piece with link to it here on GitHub)
+-- CSS                 (folder for CSS elements)
  +-- style             (style elements for the whole website)
+-- JavaScript          (folder for JavaScript elements)
  +-- index             (js elements for the whole website)
+-- README.md           (general info)
```
